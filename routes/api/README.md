# API
This folder contains all the api files as well as an index file.
* apiIndex.js: This is an index file used to reference an api's created and stored in here. It takes a '/route' and points it to a '/route' used within a specific api file.

All other files in here should be [name]Api.js files. These store the logic to talk to the database.
