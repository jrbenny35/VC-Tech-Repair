# Routes
This folder contains all of the Routes used for the server.
* Api: This folder has all of the database logic used for each route.
* Index.js: This is an index file that loads JUST the main layout.
* Partials.js: This is a script that receives the name of a partial and loads it from the views/partials folder.

These are pretty concrete scripts. All you'll need to do is add a partial to the views/partials folder and it will be usable.
