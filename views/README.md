# Views
This folder contains all the raw jade files used to actually create the webpages.
* partials: A folder used to store individual partial views used within the ui-router service.
* index.jade: This is the file rendered through the index.js route and is the starting point of our webapp.
* layout.jade: This is a file made to handle all of the layout needed for the index page.

Any page added to this webapp should be put within the partials folder.
